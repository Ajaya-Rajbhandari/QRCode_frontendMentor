### What I learned

I thought that i could make this more effective using qrcode generator and i was succeed but i got a problem that the image generated was not responsibe, so i look around and find out that frontend mentor has already the QRCode image. That help me not to use javascript. so i used that image and make it responsive using css flexbox layout. It was difficult for me to create that but using bruteforce i created that and don't know it's good or not.

### Continued development

I want to us QRCode generator api to generate qr code and make it responsive website. Although i created this, still i don't know many about css layout.

### Useful resources

--Mostly i used BlackBox Ai from VS Code which help me understand most of the things like, using qrcode generator to generate qrcode from any text.
